project #5:
This assignment was a sketch to practice using shapes as forms of buttons. the sketch was a 2-D picture of a TV with a rectanglular button labeled roar and circular button labelled boop. when the rectangular button was pressed the TV screen shows a weird black shape with a blue background. the circle button shows a purple stick figure with a neon green background.

Project #6
The assignment here was a test of using classes, to which i make a sketch of a basic little house and an cloud. the cloud moved on a loop going across the screen from left to right, all this while i had an array for rain drops going on a loop as well

Project #7
Here i had to make a sketch using some arrays, PVectors, translations of shapes, and use those translations to affect the shapes. what i did was make a stick figure with brighter colors for the arms, legs and head, as well as give it a torch and ball on string. the figure, that is meant to represent a more carnival theme, has the torch which uses an array of red sqaures as the fire, and the ball on string is a PVector that rotates opposite of the mouse cursor.

Project #8
the was an assignment where i had to make my own movie poster with text added in as well as some animation to the text on the screen. for the animation i just made it where one box of text is always there, but the moment the mouse button is clicked the other text fades in.

Project #9
this project wasn't my best but it was to just show that i could get the basics of video and sound into a sketch. in it was a video that i extracted from my phone playing in the background on loop. all the while the video is playing there is a dumb looking picture of myself poking out from the side of the screen.

Project #10
this was a group project based on making basic 3-D shapes with textures, camera controls, and lighting. so with this my partner made a cube and sphere as well as did the lighting. All while i textured the cube to look like a minecraft dirt block, and worked with the camera to go left or right whether you pressed left or right on the keyboard.
