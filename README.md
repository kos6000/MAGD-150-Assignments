project #5:
This assignment was a sketch to practice using shapes as forms of buttons. the sketch was a 2-D picture of a TV with a rectanglular button labeled roar and circular button labelled boop. when the rectangular button was pressed the TV screen shows a weird black shape with a blue background. the circle button shows a purple stick figure with a neon green background

Project #6
The assignment here was a test of using classes, to which i make a sketch of a basic little house and an cloud. the cloud moved on a loop going across the screen from left to right, all this while i had an array for rain drops going on a loop as well
